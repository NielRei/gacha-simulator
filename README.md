# 🎰 gacha-simulator
A basic customizable gacha simulator with Monte Carlo Simulation - simulate hundreds of thousands of pulls to analyze how different gacha mechanics affect probabilities and chances in gacha banners in gacha games.

Please answer the survey form for my thesis! https://forms.gle/xnt2UUgmYqDMzo7T8

# 📌 Features
- Fully customizable gacha settings
- Supports basic gacha mechanics such as drop rates, distribution rates, rate-up/non-rate-up items, hard pity systems, soft pity systems, and sparking systems!
- Detailed basic statistical data analysis and output (average/min/max pulls, ratio, distribution)
- Detailed statistical visual presentation (pie/donut charts, histogram distribution charts, plain text)
- User-friendly UI and Mobile-friendly UI - made for casual users

# ⚙️ Customizable Settings
- 5★ / 4★ Base Rates
- Rate-Up vs Non-Rate-Up Distribution (50/50, 75/25, etc...)
- Number of Rate-Up Items per Rarity
- Hard Pity System (guarantee at X pull; guarantee Rate-Up after X Non-Rate-Up loss)
- Soft Pity System (after X pull, increase rate by X% every loss)
- Sparking System (gain 1 rate-up item every total X pulls)
- Cost per Pull (irl $ per pull)
- Simulation Pulls (1-999,999 pulls)

# 📊 Statistical Results
- Item Type Distributions (number of 5★ vs 4★ vs 3★, non-rate-ups vs rate-ups, etc...)
- Average, Min, and Max Pulls to get Item (5★/4★/3★, Non-Rate-Ups/Rate-Up, etc)
- Average, Min, and Max Pulls to get One Specific Item (if there are multiple rate-up items)
- Average, Min, and Max Pulls to Complete Set of Items (pulls to get one copy of each rate-up item if there are multiple rate-up items)
- Average, Min, and Max Cost (IRL cost to get an item)
- Pull Interval Distribution (pull distances between each specific item)
- Pull Range Distribution (70% of pulls happened between pulls X and Y)
- Hard Pity Statistics (Hard Pity Hits vs Non-Hard Pity Hits)
- Soft Pity Statistics (Soft Pity Hits vs Non-Soft Pity Hits)
- Spark Statistics (Spark Hits vs Non-Spark Hits; Success vs Failure to get Rate-Up Item before Spark)
